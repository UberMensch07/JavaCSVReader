DESCRIPTION: 
	This is an application of the Java CSV Lib for Frc Robots. The
	purpose of this application is to act as an interface to the JavaCSVReader
	Lib for FRC Robots. It can be used to edit, create and save CSV files. This
	application is to make it easier for non-programmers on FRC teams to edit
	device settings in the robot program without actually editing the program
	itself. PROGRAMMERS for FRC Teams: see below for details on how to use the
	JavaCSVReader lib and this application to set up a config interface for your
	robots.
